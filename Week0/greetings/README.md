# Example programs
Here are several examples of *very* basic programs in a number of different programming languages.

## Usage
Each of these programs requires a slightly different method to run. Note that many of these commands require additional software to be downloaded and will likely only work on a Linux or Mac OS system.

* `filename` - Language ; instructions to run
* `hello.c` - C ; `gcc hello.c -o hello_in_c && ./hello_in_c`
* `hello.cpp` - C++ ; `g++ hello.cpp -o hello_in_cpp && ./hello_in_cpp`
* `hello.java` - Java ; `java hello.java`
* `hello.js` - JavaScript ; `node hello.js`
* `hello.py` - Python ; `python hello.py`
* `hello.s` - Assembly ; `as hello.s -o hello.o && ld hello.o -o hello_in_asm && ./hello_in_asm`

The simplest of these is `hello.py`, written in Python. This is the language that the beginners will be using. Notice that `hello.js`, written in JavaScript, is also quite simple. This is the language that the more advanced students will be using. Also note that `hello.s`, written in x64 Assembly, is quite complex, even though it produces the exact same output.
