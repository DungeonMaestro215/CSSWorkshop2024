# CSS Website!

I have set up a super basic website that we will build on top of this summer.

## Files
* `about.html` - The About page
* `index.html` - The Homepage
* `script.js` - Some basic Javascript for the Homepage
* `snake.html` - The page with the Snake Game
* `snake.js` - The code for the Snake Game
* `styles.css` - Stylesheets for the website

## Usage
You can download these files and open them locally on your computer. 
Additionally, the most recently updated version can be viewed on the web at [https://cs.unc.edu/~denmas22](https://cs.unc.edu/~denmas22). (**Note**: For some reason, this link is not working right now. ðŸ˜”)
